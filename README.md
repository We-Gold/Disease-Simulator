# Disease-Simulator
An educational program to simulate the spread of a disease as well as the factors that impact it.

## About This Project

This was an entry for the 2021 PA Media And Design Competition (Programming Category).
It won üèÜ second place!

## Description of the Project

This simulator is designed for educational purposes. Our goal is to demonstrate how the usage of facemasks and quarantine can impact the spread of a disease within a community. 

This program simulates people interacting in a community, as well as the spread of disease between those people.

That means the data seen in this graph came from interactions between simulated people, and not from mathematical models. 

It is important to note that this is absolutely not scientifically accurate, and the results, while often interesting, should truly be taken with a grain of salt.

## Ending Notes

I don't plan on maintaining or changing this project down the line. If you are interested in making changes, feel free to fork it and make a pull request.
